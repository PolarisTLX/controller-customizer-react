## Check it out live on Netlify:    [Controller-Customizer](https://controller-customizer-react.netlify.com/)

## Controller-Customizer Product Page

This website was a PSD-to-HTML project to realize an original design from Dribbble, which can be found here for comparison:

[Dribbble Playstickerz Concept](https://dribbble.com/shots/2129345-Playstickerz-concept)

It was brought to life using HTML, CSS and vanilla ES6 JavaScript and then upgraded to be a React app.

A mobile version was not provided, and so the design was then modified so that the website is also completely mobile responsive and optimized for all device types.

To run the webpage on your local machine, clone the repo and then open the index.html file in Chrome browser.
